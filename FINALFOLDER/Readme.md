Final Project Description:
For my final project I created a device that is similar to a dial for volume on a sound system.
The potentiometer is representative of the dial and in the code if statements determine what 
level the lights and the sound are. As the potentiometer is turned to the left the sound and lights
go down and when the potentiometer is turned to the right the sound and lights go up.
